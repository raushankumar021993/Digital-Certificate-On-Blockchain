I have shared my project work as .bna file named 'DigitalCertificate.bna'.
You can find it in the folder.

To check my Project "Digital Certification on Blockchian", You just have to upload this .bna file on Hyperledger-composer.
Once you upload it , you will be able to see my work done on Hyperledger fabric.
